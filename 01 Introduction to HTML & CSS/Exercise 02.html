		<h2>Egyptian Mau</h2>
		<h4>Egyptian Maus are a small- to medium-sized short-haired cat
			breed.</h4>

		<p>Egyptian Maus are considered one of the progenitor breeds of
			the modern domestic cat. The breed conformation is described as "a
			balance between the compactness of a Burmese and the slim elegance of
			a Siamese. Its medium-length body is muscular, with the hind legs
			longer than the front, giving the Mau the appearance of standing on
			tiptoes when upright."</p>

		<p>The Egyptian Mau is the fastest of the domestic cats, with
			its longer hind legs, and unique flap of skin extending from the
			flank to the back knee, which assists in running by allowing the legs
			to stretch back farther, providing for greater agility and length of
			stride. Maus have been clocked running more than 48 km/h (30 mph).</p>
